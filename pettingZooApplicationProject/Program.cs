/*Develop an application for the Contoso Petting Zoo that coordinates school visits. The Contoso Petting Zoo 
  is home to 18 different species of animals. At the zoo, visiting students are assigned to groups, and each 
  group has a set of animals assigned to it. After visiting their set of animals, the students will rotate 
  groups until they've seen all the animals at the petting zoo.

  By default, the students are divided into 6 groups. However, there are some classes that have a small or large 
  number of students, so the number of groups must be adjusted accordingly. The animals should also be randomly 
  assigned to each group, so as to keep the experience unique.

  The design specification for the Contoso Petting Zoo application is as follows:

  There are currently three visiting schools

    School A has six visiting groups (the default number)
    School B has three visiting groups
    School C has two visiting groups

  For each visiting school, perform the following tasks

    Randomize the animals
    Assign the animals to the correct number of groups
    Print the school name
    Print the animal groups
