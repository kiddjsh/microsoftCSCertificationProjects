/*You're helping to develop a massive multiplayer role-playing game. Each player has a luck stat 
  that can affect their odds of finding rare treasure. Each day, a player can speak to an in-game 
  fortune teller that reveals whether their luck stat is high, low, or neutral.

  The game currently has code to generate a player's fortune, but it isn't reusable. Your task is 
  to create a tellFortune method that can be called at any time, and replace the existing logic 
  with a call to your method.
